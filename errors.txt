# change behavior on fatal errors wherever possible: remember, assume, continue compilation, don't export, report
# improve globals visibility for modules and plugins
# local variable lifetime check (paranoia mode)
# trace local declaration in all conditional branches
# syntax expected datatype check where appropriate
# operation parameters expected datatype check
# dialogs: dead ends, inaccessible dialogs
# scripts: detect number of arguments and check all call_script calls
# automatically update module.ini when necessary (num_hints parameter for starters)
# check for missing/undeclared scenes in SceneObj folder
# check for missing meshes in CommonRes and Resource folder
# return compatibility with Python 2.5:
#   * remove 'with' operations
#   * remove '.format()' string method with %-substitution
